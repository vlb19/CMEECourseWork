_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Generic function for the (trimmed) arithmetic mean.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     mean(x, ...)
     
     ## Default S3 method:
     mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: An R object.  Currently there are methods for numeric/logical
          vectors and date, date-time and time interval objects.
          Complex vectors are allowed for ‘trim = 0’, only.

    trim: the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from
          each end of ‘x’ before the mean is computed.  Values of trim
          outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint.

   na.rm: a logical value indicating whether ‘NA’ values should be
          stripped before the computation proceeds.

     ...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If ‘trim’ is zero (the default), the arithmetic mean of the values
     in ‘x’ is computed, as a numeric or complex vector of length one.
     If ‘x’ is not logical (coerced to numeric), numeric (including
     integer) or complex, ‘NA_real_’ is returned, with a warning.

     If ‘trim’ is non-zero, a symmetrically trimmed mean is computed
     with a fraction of ‘trim’ observations deleted from each end
     before the mean is computed.

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R. (1988) _The New S
     Language_.  Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘weighted.mean’, ‘mean.POSIXct’, ‘colMeans’ for row and column
     means.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     x <- c(0:10, 50)
     xm <- mean(x)
     c(xm, mean(x, trim = 0.10))
