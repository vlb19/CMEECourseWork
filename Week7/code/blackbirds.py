# non-ascii symbols) because we don't care for them, first transform to ASCII:

# Now extend this script so that it captures the Kingdom, Phylum and Species
# name for each species and prints it out to screen neatly.

# Hint: you may want to use re.findall(my_reg, text)... Keep in mind that there
# are multiple ways to skin this cat! Your solution could involve multiple
# regular expression calls (slightly easier!), or a single one (slightly harder!)
